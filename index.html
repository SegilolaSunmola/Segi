        <p> Segilola Sunmola began her career as a computer engineer and was the only female in a team of 10 network system engineers. Working in a fast-paced Telco environment and often leading team projects she earned the nickname “Madame Seg”.
          Having
          a
          confident and outspoken disposition, she began volunteering as a coach and mentor with an NGO, Siddiqah Institute which focused on helping single mothers, divorcees and widows in areas of self-discovery, empowerment and financial advocacy.
          Some
          of these women have gone ahead to build successful start-ups in soap making, bead making, trading etc. She eventually transitioned to become a full staff working in the capacity as a Business Analyst, unearthing and conceptualising
          opportunities
          to ensure a successful running of the poverty alleviation and support system scheme of the organization as well as working closely with the Siddiqah heroes of “Street Kitchen” which helps provides food to people in impoverished regions in
          Nigeria.
        </p>

          Segilola is an avid reader and passionate writer. She has since found her niche in academic writing and ghost writing, and has recently added editing to her list of achievements. She edited the novel; The white elephant by Aishah Adams.
          In her spare time, she loves to run and dance, although despite her best efforts she still hasn’t mastered the trending “zanku dance” which when she performs, makes her look like an atilogwu dancer.
